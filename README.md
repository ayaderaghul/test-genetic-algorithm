# genetic-algorithm
For information on genetic algorithm, please see https://github.com/Ishikawa7/Quick-paths-to-start/blob/main/Genetic%20algorithms/README.md

# algorithm implementation and testing
the main algorithm is in `test_main.py`

run `pytest` to test the algorithm

# to run the simulation for the solution:
- edit `products.csv` file for different configuations of the problem
- enable python virtual environment
- choose how many iterations to run and the size of the population in `main.py`
- run `python3 main.py`
